**Assignment Title: Frontend Developer Challenge**

This exercise needs to be finished to completion with every feature mentioned in the **Instructions** section provided below.

## Instructions

- You have to create a **Snake Game** using [React](https://reactjs.org/).
- If you don't know the mechanics of the game, here's a [link](https://playsnake.org/). Remember, your game doesn't have to be a copy of this. Only the mechanics are important.
- The game should be playable using the 4 arrow keys.
- The game should be able to display a score.
- You have to make a GitHub repository under your profile and push all the code there.
- The game should be deployed on a static web hosting site such as `github.io` or `netlify.com`.
- In the beginning, don't focus on the animation/graphics a lot.

## Optional Features

- Make the user sign-in and allow keeping personal high-scores.
- Make a leaderboard displaying the highest scores of all time along with the username.
- Make multiple levels of the game such that after crossing one level, the speed of the snake increases by some factor.
- Allow for **rewards** which provide extra bonuses, shortening of snake length, etc.
- Think of some other additions that you can make to this classic game.
- Write unit tests/integration tests for the game.

## Restrictions

- Don't copy-paste code from anywhere on the web. We have plagiarism detectors, and if we find that you have violated this policy, your candidature will be cancelled immediately without any further deliberation.
- **Try not to use any more utility libraries.** Try to code the utilities yourself. You can use [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for a ready-made boilerplate/scaffolding.
